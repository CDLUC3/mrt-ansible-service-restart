If you need to loop over a set of tasks, put them in a separate file and use include_tasks

Here is the included file create_db_each.yml

---
- name: Check if file exists
  stat:
    path: "{{ basepath }}/{{ db_filename }}"
  register: currdb

- name: Create the file with "done" line if not present
  copy:
    content: "done"
    dest: "{{ basepath }}/{{ db_filename }}"
  when: not currdb.stat.exists | bool

used in the following create_db.yml playbook

---
- name: "Create my dbs"
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Make sure the base directory exists
      file:
        path: "{{ basepath }}"
        state: directory

    - name: load each db
      include_tasks: "create_db_each.yml"
      when: layer == 'APP'
      loop: "{{ filenames.split(',') | unique | map('trim') }}"
      loop_control:
        loop_var: db_filename
